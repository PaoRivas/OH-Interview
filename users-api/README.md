# ExpressJS & TypeScript User Management API

This project is a simple REST API built using **Express.js** and **TypeScript** that manages a list of users. The data is stored in-memory using a constant, so no database connection is needed.

## Project Description

This API allows you to:

- Register a new user.
- Retrieve a user's profile information.
- Update a user's profile information.
- Delete a user's account.

The user data is saved in a constant and is not persisted beyond the lifetime of the server process.
